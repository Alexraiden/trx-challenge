### Launch project with 'yarn start'

### Choices

I made the choice to develop the dashboard with tasks and columns in a first time because it seems to me that it is the heart for an application like trello.
I wanted to integrate the dragNdrop because for this kind of project it brings a great added value for the user experience.
Then I focused on the creation of new tasks, because without that the application is not usable.

It remains to be done :
- Add columns
- Delete/Edit tasks
- possibility to add and customize the body of the cards
- Persistence
- DragNDrop for columns
